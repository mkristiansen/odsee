# A Chef Resource and Provider that manages a Directory Server configuration.
#
# The dsconf Chef Resource and Provider can be used to manage a Directory
# Server configuration. It enables you to modify the configuration entries in
# `cn=config`. The server must be running in order for dsconf to run.

# Populates an existing suffix with LDIF data from a compressed or uncompressed
# LDIF file.
#
# @param [String, Integer] hostname
#   Connects to the directory on specified host, this can be a host name or an
#   IP address. If no host is specified the default is to use the local host.
#
# @param [Integer] port
#   Port used to connects to the directory server, If none are specified are,
#    the default is to use port 636.
#
# @param [String] async
#   Launches a task and returns the command line accessible immediately.
#
# @param [incremental] async
#   Specifies that the contents of the imported LDIF file are appended to the
#   existing LDAP entries. If this option is not specified, the contents of the
#   imported file replace the existing entries.
#
# @param [Hash] flags
#   Customizes specific subcommand.
#   Import flags:
#   * chunk-size=INTEGER
#     Sets the merge chunk size. Overrides the detection of when to start a new
#     pass during import.
#   * incremental-output
#     Specifies whether an output file will be generated for later use in
#     importing to large replicated suffixes. Default is yes. Possible values
#     are yes and no. This flag can only be used when the -K option is used.
#     If this flag is not used, an output file will automatically be generated.
#   * incremental-output-file=PATH
#     Sets the path of the generated output file for an incremental (appended)
#     import. The output file is used for updating a replication topology. It
#     is an LDIF file containing the difference between the replicated suffix
#     and the LDIF file, and replication information.
#
#   Export flags:
#   * compression-level
#     Compression level to use when a GZ_LDIF_FILE is given as operand. Default
#     level is 3, level range is from 1 to 9.
#   * multiple-output-file
#     Exports each suffix to a separate file.
#   * use-main-db-file
#     Exports the main database file only.
#   * not-export-unique-id
#     Does not export unique id values.
#   * output-not-folded
#     Does not wrap long lines.
#   * not-print-entry-ids
#     Does not export entry IDs.
#
#   Backup flags:
#   * verify-db
#     Check integrity of the backed up database.
#
#   * no-recovery
#     Skip recovery of the backed up database.
#
#   Restore flags:
#   * move-archive
#     Performs restore by moving files in place of copying them.
#
#   Rewrite flags:
#   * purge-csn
#     Purge the Change Sequence Number (CSN). The purge-csn flag is set to off
#     by default. Setting purge-csn to on prevents old CSN data from being kept
#     by the operation. This reduces the size of entries by removing traces of
#     previous updates.
#
#   convert-pwp-opattr-to-DS6
#   * Converts DS5 mode password policy operational attributes to run in
#     D6-mode. The convert-pwp-opattr-to-DS6 flag is set to off by default.
#     When a server is DS6-migration-mode enabled, setting
#     convert-pwp-opattr-to-DS6 to on, permits DS5 mode password policy
#     operational attributes to be migrated using their ID (Internet Draft) and
#     to run in DS6-mode. DS6-migration-mode is the only mode in which you can
#     migrate operational attributes safely. When the migration has been
#     successfully performed, run the server in DS6-mode when you are ready.
#
#     Note that the dsconf rewrite -f convert-pwp-opattr-to-DS6=on subcommand
#     must be run on all servers in the topology that are in DS6-migration-mode
#     in order to migrate their DS5 mode password policy operational attributes.
#
# @param [String] dn
#   Does not import or export data contained under the specified dm.
#
# @param [String] ldif_file
#   Path and filename for file in LDIF format, can be gzip compressed.
#
# @param [String] suffix
#   Suffix DN (Distinguished Name).
#
# @return [undefined]
#
# @api private
